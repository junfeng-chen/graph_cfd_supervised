This is the git repository for the paper '[Graph neural networks for laminar flow prediction around random 2D shapes](https://www.google.com)'
![architecture](./images/architecture.png)

The proposed graph convolutional neural network works on triangular meshes. It takes the coordinates of nodes and the binary encoding of the solid surface as the inputs. It predicts velocity and pressure fields around random 2D shapes at a low Reynolds number. Compare to U-nets, the graph models have higher accuracy, require fewer trainable parameters, take longer time for training.

The data set contains 2000 random 2D obstacles, together with the laminar velocity and pressure field. It was also used in the articles by:
- J. Viquerat and E. Hachem, "[A supervised neural network for drag prediction of arbitrary 2D shapes in laminar flows at low Reynolds number](https://github.com/jviquerat/cnn_drag_prediction)"
- J. Chen, J. Viquerat and E. Hachem, "[A twin-decoder structure for incompressible laminar flow reconstruction with uncertainty estimation around 2D obstacles](https://github.com/jviquerat/twin_autoencoder)"

The entire project are has been validated in **Ubuntu 20.04**. To reproduce the results, it is preferred to creat a virtual environment with **python==3.6.9**, and install the packages listed in **requirements.txt**.
